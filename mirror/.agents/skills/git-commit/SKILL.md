# Automated Git Commits

This skill provides instructions for performing atomic, well-structured Git commits following the Conventional Commits specification.

## 1. Analyze Changes
- **Identify Modified Files**: Run `git status --short` to see all staged and unstaged changes.
- **Respect Ignore Rules**: Do NOT include files that the user has explicitly requested to ignore or that match `.gitignore` patterns.
- **Group by Scope**: Group modified files by their logical "scope" (e.g., a specific module, feature, or layer like `data`, `domain`, `ui`).

## 2. Branching
- **Feature Branches**: ALWAYS create descriptive feature branches from `main` (e.g., `feat/login-logic`).
- **Merge Flow**: Merge back into `main` only after passing all quality checks and PR approval.

## 3. Generate Commit Message
- **Conventional Commits**: Each commit MUST follow the pattern: `<type>(<scope>): <message>`.
    - **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
    - **Scope**: The module or area being changed (e.g., `auth`, `api`).
    - **Message**: A concise description in imperative mood.
- **Sub-messages (Commit Body)**:
    - ALWAYS include a detailed body if the change involves logic, breaking changes, or multiple steps.
    - Explain the "What", "Why", and "How" of the change.
    - Use blank lines to separate the subject from the body.

## 3. Atomic Commits
- **One Scope per Commit**: Perform separate commits for different scopes.
- **Stage Selectively**: Stage only the files belonging to the current scope.

## 4. Execution Flow
- **Step 1**: Group files by scope.
- **Step 2**: For each group:
    - Stage the files.
    - Generate the conventional commit message (subject + body).
    - Execute:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "<subject>" -m "<body>"
      ```
- **Step 3**: Verify history (`git log -n 5`).
